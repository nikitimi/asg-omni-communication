Reference for creating credentials in Google Developer specifically for Gmail right [here](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/nodejs).

#### Email (Gmail)

- Reading(WIP show history box)
- Inbound and Outbound message with/without attachments.

#### Ingoing and Outgoing voice call

The voice call is not working as it should be but it is working under these conditions:

- The caller must copy the ID of the recipient
- The recipient must answer the call, then copy the caller's ID and also press call
- The caller must answer and press call again
- These should establish the voice call in websocket.

#### SMS/MMS

- Reading (Almost done.)
- Sending (WIP)

clicksend npm package requires manual set-up

After building the output javascript with:

```bash
  pnpm run build:clicksend
```

You need to change import for its type declaration at `./node_modules/clicksend/api.ts` generated by Swagger.

Before:

```javascript
  import localVarRequest = require('request');
  import http = require('http');
  import Promise = require('bluebird';)
```

After:

```javascript
import localVarRequest from "request";
import http from "http";
import Promise from "bluebird";
```

then install the other devDependencies(or theoretically avoid the type check for this.):

```bash
  pnpm add -D @types/bluebird @types/request
```

#### Realtime-chat

- Delay in effect of showing the chats with `useRealtimeMessage` custom hook.
- Currently need to have 3 accounts to interact with to show the messages for the actual target recipient.
