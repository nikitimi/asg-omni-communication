clicksend npm package requires manual set-up

After building the output javascript with:

```bash
  pnpm run build:clicksend
```

You need to change import for its type declaration at `./node_modules/clicksend/api.ts` generated by Swagger.

Before:

```javascript
  import localVarRequest = require('request');
  import http = require('http');
  import Promise = require('bluebird';)
```

After:

```javascript
import localVarRequest from "request";
import http from "http";
import Promise from "bluebird";
```

then install the other devDependencies(or theoretically avoid the type check for this.):

```bash
  pnpm add -D @types/bluebird @types/request
```
